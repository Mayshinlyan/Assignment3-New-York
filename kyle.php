        <h3>About Kyle</h3>

        <p>I’m a total nerd. And, like most nerds, I played a lot of video games as a kid. I eventually got bored of playing the same games, so I started to modify the code behind my games: adding to them, perfecting them. I didn't know it then, but that was just the start of my love of programming. I moved on from just coding video games to learning multiple programming languages and coding more and more, both in the classroom and beyond.

        <h3>How Kyle landed to Computer Science?</h3>

        <p>I began my undergraduate career at the University of Rochester studying genetics with a focus in premedical studies. The second semester of my freshman year, I went out on a limb and took CSC171 (Introduction to Java). I knew that the class would be difficult, especially since I had absolutely zero experience in programming, but it ended up being the best choice I made in college! Starting my sophomore year, I switched to a computer science major and have not looked back since! I dived into the major, taking as many courses as I could possibly take in a given semester in order to keep up with the other students in my class and graduate on time. To this day, I am so glad that I ended up switching majors and my career trajectory. Ever since I wrote my first “Hello, World!” program, I have been completely sold on computer science as both a career, pastime, and continuous education.
