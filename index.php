    <h2>Kyle Pollock</h2>
        

    <p>I'm a total nerd. And, like most nerds, I played a lot of video games as a kid. I eventually got bored of playing the same games, so I started to modify the code behind my games: adding to them, perfecting them. I didn't know it then, but that was just the start of my love of programming. I moved on from just coding video games to learning multiple programming languages and coding more and more, both in the classroom and beyond. </p>

    <h2>Conley Ernst</h2>

	<p>I am a Junior at the University of Rochester double majoring in Computer Science and Digital Media Studies, which provides the unique intersection of engineering and creative arts. Studying to be a software engineer, my academic and professional experience has given me a strong understanding of both the technical and user experience sides of a product.</p>

    <h2>James Fazio</h2>
        
	<p>I have always been interested in AI and the way that computers can think fo themselves, but my true interest was sparked by the class I took my senior year of high school. It was a class based on current events and current technology, and my interest in that class directly translated into my college career.</p>
