        <h3>About James</h3>

        <p>I have always been interested in AI and the way that computers can think fo themselves, but my true interest was sparked by the class I took my senior year of high school. It was a class based on current events and current technology, and my interest in that class directly translated into my college career.

        <h3>How James landed to Computer Science?</h3>

        <p>Over the past seven semesters here at the University of Rochester, I have had an interesting journey. Since my high school did not have a computer science department, I did not have any programming experience whatsoever when I starting school here in the Fall of 2014. I held an immense interest in the world of technology however, so I was pretty set coming in about the major choice of computer science. It took me no more than one semester (and a D-) in CHM II to realize that chemistry was not for me. I think back at that now and wonder what I was thinking. I went the rest of my sophomore year without a major in mind, but I began taking computer science class again to see how I would do. After taking CSC 170 and loving it, I took 171 (Intro to Java) and 172 (Data Structures and Algorithms) and realized that CS was definitely the major for me. I declared my major later than normal, in the fall of my Junior year, but I was finally on the right track.

        <h3>Work Experience</h3>

        <p> 
          From November of 2015 through August of 2017, I worked as a Specialist at an Apple Retail Store. As a self-proclaimed Apple enthusiast, I had always wanted to work for the company in any capacity and applied for a retail spot when I turned 18. A full year later, I received an email invitation to a hiring event, Appleâ€™s unique but effective format of selecting its employees. After five total interviews/events and a month of training and shadowing, I was officially a Specialist at Apple. Working for Apple, even at the retail level, was an incredible experience. The entire 90+ employee team worked and communicated together like nothing I had ever seen before, and it was clear that Apple Corporate had a genuine respect for its retail workers. Over the course of my almost two years at Apple, I developed a number of strong relationships with my coworkers, and it really did feel like a family; you would be very hard-pressed to find a retail setting that incorporates this level of team-building, and Apple nails it. I left the company in August of 2017 to focus on schoolwork, as I work towards graduating in the Spring and pursuing a position in software or web engineering.
